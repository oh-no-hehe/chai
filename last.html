        <P><b>Hi babe,</b> <br><br>
I hope you’re doing well. I just wanted to remind you how thankful I am that God granted me someone I was truly looking for and yes, I was looking for you, no one else.

Being with you makes me feel so special. You’re caring, loving, understanding, and let’s be real drop-dead gorgeous (as always).

I want to say sorry for the times I messed up. I swear, I’m working on becoming the better version of myself for you, for us.

Even though we’re miles apart right now, my love for you never fades. My loyalty, my heart, my thoughts they’re all yours. Always have been, always will be.

And hey, I just want you to know… I’m so proud of you. Watching you chase your dreams and push through your review is inspiring. Don’t let pressure get to you, okay? You’re doing better than you think. Just breathe, smile, and trust yourself. You've got this.

I love you so much, babe.
Happy Monthsary! 

Love,
Your biggest fan </P>
